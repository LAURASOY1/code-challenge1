#STUDENT GRADING PROGRAM

-This is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user to input a student's marks and determines the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

A > 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

Run the program in a JavaScript environment, such as a web browser console.
When prompted, enter the student's marks.
The program will then calculate and display the corresponding grade for the entered marks.
