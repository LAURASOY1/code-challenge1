SPEED CHECKER PROGRAM

This is a simple JavaScript program that calculates demerit points for speeding drivers based on the provided speed.

Usage

 Run the program in a JavaScript environment, such as a web browser console or a Node.js environment.
 Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
 The program will output either "Ok" if the speed is less than 70, or it will calculate and print the demerit points.
